'''
Problem statement : The Fibonacci strings are a series of recursivelyÂ­defined strings. F(0) is the string a, F(1) is
the string bc, and F(n+2) is the concatenation of F(n) and F(n+1). For example, F(2) is abc, F(3) is
bcabc, F(4) is abcbcabc, etc. 
Given a number n and an index k, return the kth character of
the string F(n)
